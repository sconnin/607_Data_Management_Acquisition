## Project Description 

Import a text file (tournamentinfo.txt) into R and then clean & wrangle that data for future analyses.The text file consists of a single, semi-structured, document containing chess tournament results and related information.  

![Adapted from: https://www.masterclass.com/articles/chess-piece-guide](Chess.PNG)

The project deliverable is a single csv file with data extracted from the parent text as well as related summary information, including the following attributes:

* Player's Name
* Player's State
* Total Number of Points
* Playerâ€™s Pre-Rating
* Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents

Project files and related script are available on Github at the following URL: https://github.com/sconnin/607PROJ1.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(magrittr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```

### STEP 1. Import Text Data into R

I imported the text file using the read_delim() function. The result was a single column dataframe with 195 rows. It's worth noting that a multi-column data-frame could also be constructed during import as follows: 

df <- read.delim("file path", header = FALSE, sep = "|")

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=2}

data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sconnin/607PROJ1/main/tournamentinfo.txt")

```
### STEP 2. Extract Key Attributes 

To facilitate data review and string matching, I first converted the dataframe into a matrix, with each line of data as a single character string.

Each player's record was distributed within consecutive 2-line sequences. Using str_match(), I pulled relevant data into separate, temporary, dataframes for each line and then combined these data-frames into a final, single, dataframe. The result was a Tidy dataset with one row entry for each player.

Note: I used drop_na() to remove lines with non-alphanumeric data and thus avoid row errors during str_match(). 

```{r,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  results="hide" }

df<-data%>%as.matrix()%>%str_trim()

(d1<-df%>%str_match("^\\d+.+$")%>%
        as.data.frame()%>%
        drop_na()%>%
        separate(1,c("Id", "Name", "Total_Points",
        "R1","R2","R3","R4","R5","R6","R7"),sep="\\|"))

(d2<-df%>%str_match("^\\D{2}\\s.+R:\\s*\\d+")%>%
        as.data.frame()%>%drop_na()%>%
        separate(1,c("State", "Temp"), sep="\\|")%>%
        separate(2,c("e","Player_Pre_Ratings"), sep="R:")%>%
        select(-e))

df<-cbind(d1,d2)%>%relocate(Player_Pre_Ratings, .after=Name)%>%
    relocate(State, .after=Name)%>%
    relocate(Total_Points, .after=State)

```
View of dataframe (df) following Step 2:
```{r}

head(df, 5)%>%kbl%>%kable_material(c("striped"))

```

### STEP 3. Remove Word-Characters from Select Columns

In this step I removed word-characters from columns ("R1-R7") containing combined game wins/losses and contender "Id" and then removed any remaining white-space from the respective values. 

```{r}

df%<>%mutate_at(vars("R1","R2","R3","R4","R5","R6","R7"), ~str_replace(.,"\\w\\s", ""))

df[sapply(df,is.character)] <- lapply(df[sapply(df,is.character)], trimws)

head(df, 5)%>%kbl%>%kable_material(c("striped"))

```
### STEP 4. Match Player Id and Pre_Player_Ratings 

I then replaced each player's contender Id in columns R1-R7 with the latter's pre_player rating. To accomplish this, I matched opponent information (Id) across columns/rows. I received helpful suggestions on Stack Exchange to build code for this step: https://bit.ly/3qLtBP0.


```{r}

df[c("R1", "R2", "R3", "R4", "R5","R6","R7")] <- lapply(df[c("R1", "R2", "R3", "R4", "R5","R6","R7")], function(x) df$Player_Pre_Ratings[match(x, df$Id)])

head(df, 5)%>%kbl%>%kable_material(c("striped"))
```
### STEP 5. Calculate Average Pre-Chess Rating of Opponents 

In this step, I converted columns R1-R7 into numeric form and saved the mean of these values into a new column. 

Note: The presence of NA values (empty cells) can impede row-mean calculations. To avoid this problem, I first converted all NA entries to 0. 

```{r}
df%<>%mutate_at(c("R1", "R2", "R3", "R4", "R5","R6","R7"), as.numeric)

df%<>%replace(is.na(.),0)%>%
    mutate(Avg_Pre_Chess_Rating_of_Opponent = rowMeans(df[,c("R1", "R2", "R3", "R4", "R5","R6","R7")]))%>%
    mutate_at("Avg_Pre_Chess_Rating_of_Opponent", as.integer)
                                   
head(df, 5)%>%kbl%>%kable_material(c("striped"))

```
### STEP 6. Select and Save Final DataFrame in CSV Format

In this final step, I selected the relevant subset of columns and exported this information into a .csv formatted file. 

```{r}

df%<>%select(Name, State, Total_Points, Player_Pre_Ratings,Avg_Pre_Chess_Rating_of_Opponent)

write.csv(df, file = "607Proj1_complete.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
